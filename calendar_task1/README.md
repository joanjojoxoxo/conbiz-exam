# README for Calendar Task1 React App
This README guides you through the process of setting up a React application named calendar_task1. Follow the steps below to create your project folder, replace the src and public directories with those from the calendar_task1 app, and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 1: Create React App

Open your terminal and run the command: `npx create-react-app calendar_task1`. This command creates a new directory named calendar_task1 with all the necessary files and dependencies for a React app.

## Step 2: Replace src and public Directories

1. Navigate to your new calendar_task1 project folder.
2. See the existing src and public folders. 
3. Copy the src and public folders from the calendar_task1 given by the candidate 'Joan Huang' and paste them to replace existing src and public folders in your project directory.

## Step 3: Run the App

Now project is set up and the necessary directories are replaced, open the terminal and run the app locally by using: `npm start`.
